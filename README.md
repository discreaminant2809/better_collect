Provides a composable, declarative way to consume an iterator.

If [`Iterator`] is the "source half" of data pipeline, [`Collector`] is the "sink half" of the pipeline.

In order words, [`Iterator`] describes how to produce data, and [`Collector`] describes how to consume it.

## Motivation

Suppose we are given an array of `i32` and we are asked to find its sum and maximum value.
What would be our approach?

- Approach 1: Two-pass

```rust
let nums = [1, 3, 2];
let sum: i32 = nums.into_iter().sum();
let max = nums.into_iter().max().unwrap();

assert_eq!(sum, 6);
assert_eq!(max, 3);
```

**Cons:** This performs two passes over the data, which is worse than one-pass in performance.
That is fine for arrays, but can be much worse for [`HashSet`], [`LinkedList`],
or... data from an IO stream.

- Approach 2: [`Iterator::fold()`]

```rust
let nums = [1, 3, 2];
let (sum, max) = nums
    .into_iter()
    .fold((0, i32::MIN), |(sum, max), num| {
        (sum + num, max.max(num))
    });

assert_eq!(sum, 6);
assert_eq!(max, 3);
```

**Cons:** Not very declarative. The main logic is still kind of procedural.
(Doing sum and max by ourselves)

- Approach 3: [`Iterator::inspect()`]

```rust
let nums = [1, 3, 2];
let mut sum = 0;
let max = nums
    .into_iter()
    .inspect(|i| sum += i)
    .max()
    .unwrap();

assert_eq!(sum, 6);
assert_eq!(max, 3);
```

**Cons:** This approach has multiple drawbacks:

- If the requirement changes to "calculate sum and find any negative value,"
  this approach may produce incorrect results.
  The "any" logic may short-circuit on finding the desired value,
  preventing the "sum" logic from summing every value.
  It is possible that we can rearrange so that the "any" logic goes first,
  but if the requirement changes to "find any negative value and even value,"
  we cannot escape.

- The state is kept outside. Now the iterator cannot go anywhere else
  (e.g. sending to another thread, sending through a channel).

- Very unintuitive and hack-y (hard to reason about).

- And most importantly, not declarative enough.

This crate proposes a one-pass, declarative approach:

```rust
use komadori::{prelude::*, cmp::Max};

let nums = [1, 3, 2];
let (sum, max) = nums
    .into_iter()
    .feed_into(i32::adding().tee(Max::new()));

assert_eq!(sum, 6);
assert_eq!(max.unwrap(), 3);
```

This approach achieves both one-pass and declarative, while is also composable (more of this later).

This is only with integers. How about with a non-`Copy` type?

```rust
// Suppose we open a connection...
fn socket_stream() -> impl Iterator<Item = String> {
    ["the", "noble", "and", "the", "singer"]
        .into_iter()
        .map(String::from)
}

// Task: Returns:
// - An array of data from the stream.
// - How many bytes were read.
// - The last-seen data.

// Usually, we're pretty much stuck with for-loop
// (tradition, `(try_)fold`, `(try_)for_each`).
// No common existing tools can help us here:
let mut byte_read = 0_usize;
let mut received = vec![];
let mut last_seen = None;

for data in socket_stream() {
    byte_read += data.len();
    received.push(data.clone());
    last_seen = Some(data);
}

let expected = (byte_read, received, last_seen);

// This crate's way:
use komadori::{prelude::*, iter::Last, clb_mut};

let ((byte_read, received), last_seen) = socket_stream()
    .feed_into(
        usize::adding()
            .map(
                clb_mut!(|s: &mut String| -> usize { s.len() })
            )
            .tee_funnel(vec![])
            .tee_clone(Last::new())
    );

assert_eq!((byte_read, received, last_seen), expected);
```

Very declarative! We describe what we want to collect.

You might think this is just like [`Iterator::unzip()`]...

Consider this example:

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;
use komadori::{prelude::*, clb_mut};

// Suppose we open a connection...
fn socket_stream() -> impl Iterator<Item = String> {
    ["the", "noble", "and", "the", "singer"]
        .into_iter()
        .map(String::from)
}

// Task: Collect UNIQUE chunks of data and concatenate them.

// `Iterator::unzip`
let unzip_way: (String, HashSet<_>) = socket_stream()
    // Sad. We have to clone.
    // We can't take a reference, since the referenced data is returned too.
    .map(|chunk| (chunk.clone(), chunk))
    .unzip();

// Another approach is do two passes (collect to `Vec`, then iterate),
// which is still another allocation,
// or `Iterator::fold`, which's procedural.

// `Collector`
let collector_way = socket_stream()
    // No clone. The data flows smoothly.
    .feed_into(
        String::new()
            .into_concat()
            .map(clb_mut!(|s: &mut String| -> &str { &s[..] }))
            .tee_funnel(HashSet::new())
    );

assert_eq!(unzip_way, collector_way);
```

## Crate stucture

Modules in this crate mirror those in the standard library, because this crate
extends many types there. There is also `collector` which
contains collector functionalities that work behind [`feed_into()`],
and `prelude` which re-exports commons items for easier use.

It is recommended to read the documentation of `collector` next
if you want to delve into how collectors work.

## Features

- **`alloc`** — Enables collectors and implementations for types in the
  [`alloc`] crate (e.g., [`Vec`], [`VecDeque`], [`BTreeSet`]).

- **`std`** *(default)* — Enables the `alloc` feature and implementations
  for [`std`]-only types (e.g., [`HashMap`]).
  When this feature is disabled, the crate builds in `no_std` mode.

- **`itertools`** — Enables collectors and adapters that resemble those
  in the `itertools` crate.

- **`unstable`** — Enables experimental and unstable features.
  Items gated behind this feature do **not** follow normal semver guarantees
  and may change or be removed at any time.

  Although the crate as a whole is technically still experimental, the items under
  `unstable` are even more experimental, and it is generally
  discouraged to use them until their designs are finalized and not
  under this flag anymore.
