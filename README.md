# better_collect

Provides a composable, declarative way to consume an iterator.

If [`Iterator`] is the "source half" of data pipeline, [`Collector`] is the "sink half" of the pipeline.

In order words, [`Iterator`] describes *how to produce* data, and [`Collector`] describes *how to consume* it.

## Motivation

Suppose we are given an array of `i32` and we are asked to find its sum and maximum value.
What would be our approach?

- Approach 1: Two-pass

```rust
let nums = [1, 3, 2];
let sum: i32 = nums.into_iter().sum();
let max = nums.into_iter().max().unwrap();

assert_eq!(sum, 6);
assert_eq!(max, 3);
```

**Cons:** This performs two passes over the data, which is worse than one-pass in performance.
That is fine for arrays, but can be much worse for [`HashSet`], [`LinkedList`],
or... data from an IO stream.

- Approach 2: [`Iterator::fold`]

```rust
let nums = [1, 3, 2];
let (sum, max) = nums
    .into_iter()
    .fold((0, i32::MIN), |(sum, max), num| {
        (sum + num, max.max(num))
    });

assert_eq!(sum, 6);
assert_eq!(max, 3);
```

**Cons:** Not very declarative â€” the main logic is still kind of procedural. (Doing sum and max by ourselves)

This crate proposes a one-pass, declarative approach:

```rust
use better_collect::{
    Collector, RefCollector, BetterCollect,
    num::Sum, cmp::Max,
};

let nums = [1, 3, 2];
let (sum, max) = nums
    .into_iter()
    .better_collect(Sum::<i32>::new().then(Max::new()));

assert_eq!(sum, 6);
assert_eq!(max.unwrap(), 3);
```

This approach achieves both one-pass and declarative, while is also composable (more of this later).

This is only with integers. How about with a non-`Copy` type?

```rust
// Suppose we open a connection...
fn socket_stream() -> impl Iterator<Item = String> {
    ["12", "34", "not an integer", "56"]
        .into_iter()
        .map(String::from)
}

// Task: Returns:
// - An array of `i32` successfully parsed from the stream (skip all unparsable data).
// - How many bytes were read.
// - The last-seen data.

// Usually, we're pretty much stuck with for-loop (tradition, `(try_)fold`, `(try_)for_each`).
// No common existing tools can help us here:
let mut received = vec![];
let mut byte_read = 0_usize;
let mut last_seen = None;

for data in socket_stream() {
    received.push(data.clone());
    byte_read += data.len();
    last_seen = Some(data);
}

let expected = (received, byte_read, last_seen);

// This crate's way:
use better_collect::{
    Collector, RefCollector, BetterCollect,
    Last, num::Sum,
};

let ((received, byte_read), last_seen) = socket_stream()
    .better_collect(
        vec![]
            .cloned()
            // Use `map_ref` so that our collector is a `RefCollector`
            // (only a `RefCollector` is then-able)
            .then(Sum::<usize>::new().map_ref(|data: &mut String| data.len()))
            .then(Last::new())
    );

assert_eq!((received, byte_read, last_seen), expected);
```

Very declarative! We describe what we want to collect.

You might think this is just like [`Iterator::unzip`], but this crate does a bit better:
it can split the data and feed separately **WITHOUT** additional allocation.

To demonstrate the difference, take this example:

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;
use better_collect::{Collector, RefCollector, BetterCollect};

// Suppose we open a connection...
fn socket_stream() -> impl Iterator<Item = String> {
    ["a", "b", "c", "b"]
        .into_iter()
        .map(String::from)
}

// Task: Collect UNIQUE chunks of data and concatenate them.

// `Iterator::unzip`
let (chunks, concatenated_data): (HashSet<_>, String) = socket_stream()
    // Sad. We have to clone.
    // We can't take a reference, since the referenced data is returned too.
    .map(|chunk| (chunk.clone(), chunk))
    .unzip();

let unzip_way = (concatenated_data, chunks);

// Another approach is do two passes (collect to `Vec`, then iterate),
// which is still another allocation,
// or `Iterator::fold`, which's procedural.

// `Collector`
let collector_way = socket_stream()
    // No clone - the data flows smoothly.
    .better_collect(String::new().then(HashSet::new()));

assert_eq!(unzip_way, collector_way);
```

## Traits

Unlike [`std::iter`], this crate has two main traits instead. Roughtly:

```rust
use std::ops::ControlFlow;

pub trait Collector<T>: Sized {
    type Output;
    fn collect(&mut self, item: T) -> ControlFlow<()>;
    fn finish(self) -> Self::Output;
}

pub trait RefCollector<T>: Collector<T> {
    fn collect_ref(&mut self, item: &mut T) -> ControlFlow<()>;
}
```

[`Collector`] is akin to [`Extend`], except it also returns [`ControlFlow`] to hint
whether it permanently stops receiving items after calling [`collect`](Collector::collect).
It is a helpful hint for some adaptors (e.g. [`Then`], [`Chain`]) to "vectorize" the rest of
the items to another collector. After returning ``

[`RefCollector`] is a collector that does not need the ownership of an item to collect it.
The reason this trait exists is to allow an item to pass down through every collector without
any of them consumes it. This allows multiple consumptions from just one item instead of cloning it
to each collector, which is one of the main ideas of this crate. [`RefCollector`] powers [`then`](RefCollector::then),
which establishes a pipeline of collectors and lets an item from the iterator pass down safely without being
collected by ownership midway, to the last one when it is allowed to take the ownership of the item.

Finally, [`BetterCollect`] adds a method [`better_collect`](BetterCollect::better_collect) to [`Iterator`]
to "use" [`Collector`]. It extracts items from the iterator to the collector, then makes the collector
produces the result. The trait has to be imported to be able to use the method.

More detail can be found in their respected docs.

## Features

- `alloc`: Enables implementations for types in the [`alloc`] crate (e.g. [`Vec`], [`VecDeque`], [`BTreeSet`]).
- `std`: Enables the `alloc` feature, and implementations for [`std`]-only types (e.g. [`HashSet`]).

## Todos

- More detailed documentation.
- More adaptors (this crate currently only has common ones).
- Possibly foreign implementations for types in other crates.
